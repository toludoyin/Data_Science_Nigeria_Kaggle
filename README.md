Created a machine learning model to  predict the best offer of car insurance for the company to sustain its reign

Model: Gradient Boosting, is a machine learning ensemble learner(i.e it create final model based on collection of individual model and this is because the individual power are weak and prone to overfitting but combining the many individual weak model in an ensemble will lead to an overall improved result) techniques for regression and classification that minimise error in the overall model. The most common type of weak model used is decision tree
